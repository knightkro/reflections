When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you need a way to back up your work remotely, a way to easily collaborate and a way to share your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you can control the updates and have a logical sequence of changes.
