When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you need a way to back up your work remotely, a way to easily collaborate and a way to share your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you can control the updates and have a logical sequence of changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a remote copy of a repository done only on github. A clone is a copy of a repository remotely or locally. A branch is a copy within a repository.
You would use a fork to copy someones repository to your own within github, a clone to copy to your own machine and a branch to work on something without changing the main branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can check and comapre changes to your local repository offline.
